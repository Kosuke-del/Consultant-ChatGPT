ChatGPT and other large language models have the potential to improve healthcare delivery and enhance patients' quality of life. However, they need to be tailored to specific clinical needs. These models use deep learning to reproduce human language in a convincing way and are already being used in various business applications. In healthcare, they could assist patients in communicating with healthcare workers and with each other, thereby improving compliance with medical prescriptions and strengthening relationships between patients and healthcare professionals. Nonetheless, caution is needed to avoid miscommunication and ensure the positive impact on patients' well-being.
